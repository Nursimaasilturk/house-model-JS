                Country French-style homes in the United States date back to the
                18th century. At that time, France occupied much of eastern
                North America, with settlements scattered along the principal
                waterways, such as the St. Lawrence, Great Lakes, and
                Mississippi valleys. French building traditions started to fade
                after President Thomas Jefferson purchased Louisiana in 1803,
                but this house style remained popular in New Orleans and other
                areas for another half-century.

                This style's name suggests a close connection to the
                16th-century architecture of England's Tudor dynasty. But the
                Tudor houses we see today are modern-day reinventions loosely
                based on a variety of Late Medieval English prototypes.

                Mediterranean-style architecture gave birth to the Spanish
                Colonial Revival style that flourished in Southern California
                during the 1920s and 1930s following a noteworthy appearance at
                the Panama-California Exposition of 1915.

                There are several styles of houses (such as Queen Anne) that
                fall within the Victorian era, which lasted from 1837 to
                1901.Homes of the Victorian Era had interiors that were
                romantic, distinctive, and abundant in detail, from the patterns
                of their fabrics to their colors and textures.
